# SOLID Principles in C#

This repository demonstrates the implementation of SOLID principles in C#. SOLID is an acronym for the first five object-oriented design (OOD) principles suggested by Robert C. Martin. These principles make it easier to manage software complexity, particularly through software maintainability.

## Projects

The repository contains separate console applications for each principle:

1. `SRP_Without` - Single Responsibility Principle without applying the principle.
2. `SRP_With` - Single Responsibility Principle with the principle applied.
3. `OCP_Without` - Open Closed Principle without applying the principle.
4. `OCP_With` - Open Closed Principle with the principle applied.
5. `LSP_Without` - Liskov Substitution Principle without applying the principle.
6. `LSP_With` - Liskov Substitution Principle with the principle applied.
7. `ISP_Without` - Interface Segregation Principle without applying the principle.
8. `ISP_With` - Interface Segregation Principle with the principle applied.
9. `DIP_Without` - Dependency Inversion Principle without applying the principle.
10. `DIP_With` - Dependency Inversion Principle with the principle applied.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- .NET 6.0 or later
- A text editor or an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code.

### Running the Applications

Navigate to the folder of the application you want to run, then use the `dotnet run` command in your terminal.

```bash
cd SRP_With
dotnet run
```

Replace SRP_With with the name of the application you wish to run.
